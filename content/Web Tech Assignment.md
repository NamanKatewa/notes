### 2.You have been hired to design a simple webpage for a local art gallery. The gallery wants a clean and organized layout that emphasizes a clear separation between content and presentation. Using HTML for content and CSS for styling, complete the following tasks:

- Create the Basic Webpage Layout: 
	Structure the webpage using HTML, including a header section with the gallery’s name, a few paragraphs describing the gallery, and an image of the gallery's logo. 
    

- Implement CSS Styling: 
	
	Apply inline styles for one part of the webpage (e.g., the logo image) to give it a unique appearance. 
	
	For the remaining elements, link an external CSS file that will define the styling rules for the rest of the page.     

- Use CSS Selectors: 
    
	 Utilize both class and id selectors in the external CSS file to apply different styles. For example, style the header with an id selector to distinguish it, and style individual paragraphs with class selectors to differentiate content sections. 

- Styling Specifications: 
    
	 Ensure that the header is prominently styled with a larger font size and background color.
