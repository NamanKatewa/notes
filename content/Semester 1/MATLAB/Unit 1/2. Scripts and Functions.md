## Scripts

  - Create, save, and run MATLAB scripts.
  - Scripts are files with a `.m` extension that contain a sequence of MATLAB commands.
  - Share workspace variables with the base workspace.

## Functions

  - Encapsulate code within a function file.
  - Functions have their own workspace and accept input/output arguments.
  - Defined using the `function` keyword and saved as `.m` files.
  - Example:
    ```matlab
    function output = myFunction(input)
        output = input^2;
    end
    ```

## Key Differences

  - Scripts operate on the base workspace, while functions have a local workspace.
  - Functions are reusable and can take arguments, whereas scripts cannot.
