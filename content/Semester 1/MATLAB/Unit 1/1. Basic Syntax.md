## Types of Operands


|  Operand  | Function                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :-------: | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     +     | Addition                       | Addition or unary plus. `A + B` adds the values stored in variables `A` and `B`. `A` and `B` must have the same size unless one is a scalar. A scalar can be added to a matrix of any size.                                 |
|     -     | Subtraction                    | Subtraction or unary minus. `A - B` subtracts the value of `B` from `A`. `A` and `B` must have the same size unless one is a scalar. A scalar can be subtracted from a matrix of any size.                                  |
|     *     | Matrix Multiplication          | `C = A * B` is the linear algebraic product of matrices `A` and `B`. For non-scalar inputs, the number of columns in `A` must equal the number of rows in `B`. A scalar can multiply a matrix of any size.                  |
|    .*     | Array Multiplication           | Element-by-element multiplication. `A .* B` computes the product of corresponding elements in arrays `A` and `B`. Both must have the same size unless one is a scalar.                                                      |
|     /     | Right Division                 | Matrix right division. `B / A` is roughly the same as `B * inv(A)`. More precisely, `B / A = (A' \ B')'`.                                                                                                                   |
|    ./     | Array Right Division           | Element-by-element right division. `A ./ B` computes the element-wise division `A(i,j) / B(i,j)`. Both `A` and `B` must have the same size unless one is a scalar.                                                          |
|     \     | Left Division                  | Matrix left division. If `A` is square, `A \ B` is roughly the same as `inv(A) * B`. It solves the equation `AX = B`. A warning is displayed if `A` is nearly singular.                                                     |
|    .\     | Array Left Division            | Element-by-element left division. `A .\ B` computes `B(i,j) / A(i,j)` element-wise. Both `A` and `B` must have the same size unless one is a scalar.                                                                        |
|     ^     | Scalar & Matrix Exponentiation | Matrix power. `X ^ p` computes `X` to the power `p`. If `p` is an integer, it uses repeated squaring. For non-integer `p`, it uses eigenvalue decomposition.                                                                |
|    .^     | Array Exponentiation           | Element-wise exponentiation. `A .^ B` computes `A(i,j)` to the power of `B(i,j)` element-wise. Both must have the same size unless one is a scalar.                                                                         |
|     '     | Transpose                      | Transposes a matrix. `A'` computes the complex conjugate transpose (Hermitian transpose) of `A`. It flips the rows and columns and also takes the complex conjugate of each element if the matrix contains complex numbers. |
|    .'     | Array Transpose                | Transposes a matrix without taking the complex conjugate. `A.'` flips the rows and columns but does not affect the values of complex numbers.                                                                               |
|   sin()   | Sine of angle                  | Computes the sine of angles in radians.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  sqrt()   | Square root of a number        | Computes the square root of a number.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|    ans    | Most recent answer             | Stores the most recent result from the command window.                                                                                                                                                                      |

|    Inf    | Infinity                       | Represents infinity.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Use of Semicolon

Semicolon indicates end of an expression.
But semicolon also suppressed the output of a statement.
If we add a semi colon at the end of an expression. The output of that expression won't be printed in the console.

## Comments

% (percent) symbol is used for indicating a comment line.

## Variables

- In MATLAB every variable is an array or matrix.

		x = 3;
		Creates a 1x1 matrix and stores the value 3 in it.

- Once a variable is entered into the system, you can refer to it later.

		y = 4;
		x + y

- Variables must have values before they are used.
- When an expression returns a result that is not assigned to any variable, the system assigns it to a variable named ans, which can be used later.
- Multiple Assignments

		a = 2; b = 7; c = a* b

	r = [ 7 8 9 10 11]
	r = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

### Column Vectors

Using semicolon to separate values

	c = [7; 8; 9; 10; 11]


## Matrices

Two Dimensional array of numbers

	m = [ 1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
	Semicolon separates the rows.
	Spaces or Commas separates the columns.
