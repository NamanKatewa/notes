## Use of Semicolon

Semicolon indicates end of an expression.
But semicolon also suppressed the output of a statement.
If we add a semi colon at the end of an expression. The output of that expression won't be printed in the console.

## Comments

% (percent) symbol is used for indicating a comment line.

## Variables

- In MATLAB every variable is an array or matrix.

		x = 3;
		Creates a 1x1 matrix and stores the value 3 in it.

- Once a variable is entered into the system, you can refer to it later.

		y = 4;
		x + y

- Variables must have values before they are used.
- When an expression returns a result that is not assigned to any variable, the system assigns it to a variable named ans, which can be used later.
- Multiple Assignments

		a = 2; b = 7; c = a* b

## Vectors

One Dimensional array of numbers

### Row Vectors

Using space or comma to separate values

	r = [ 7 8 9 10 11]
	r = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

### Column Vectors

Using semicolon to separate values

	c = [7; 8; 9; 10; 11]


## Matrices

Two Dimensional array of numbers

	m = [ 1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
	Semicolon separates the rows.
	Spaces or Commas separates the columns.
