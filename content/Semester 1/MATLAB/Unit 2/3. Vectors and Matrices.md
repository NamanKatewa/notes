## A vector is a one dimensional array
## A matrix is a two dimensional array


## Row Vectors

Enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using space or comma to delimit.

```matlab
r = [7 8 9 10]
r = [7, 8, 9, 10]
```


## Column Vectors

Enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using semicolon to delimit.

```matlab
c = [7; 8; 9; 10;]
```

## Accessing Elements of a Vector

```matlab
v = [1; 2; 3; 4;]
v(3)
v(:)
v(1:3)
```

v(3) - > 3
v(:) -> the whole vector
v(1:3) -> element 1 to 3 -> 1,2,3


## Addition and Subtraction of Vectors

Both the vectors must be of the same type and have the same number of elements.

```matlab
A = [7, 11, 15, 23, 9];
B = [2, 5, 13, 16, 20];
C = A + B;
D = A - B;
disp(C);
disp(D);
```


## Scalar Multiplication of Vectors

Multiplying a vector by a number.

```matlab
v = [ 12 34 10 8];
m = 5 * v
```

## Transpose of a Vector

Changes a column vector into row vector and vice-versa.

```matlab
r = [ 1 2 3 4 ];
tr = r';
v = [1;2;3;4];
tv = v';
disp(tr); disp(tv);
```
