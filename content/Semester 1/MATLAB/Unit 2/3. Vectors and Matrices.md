## A vector is a one dimensional array
## A matrix is a two dimensional array


## Row Vectors

Enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using space or comma to delimit.

```matlab
r = [7 8 9 10]
r = [7, 8, 9, 10]
```


## Column Vectors

Enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using semicolon to delimit.

```matlab
c = [7; 8; 9; 10;]
```

## Accessing Elements of a Vector

```matlab
v = [1; 2; 3; 4;]
v(3)
v(:)
v(1:3)
```

v(3) - > 3
v(:) -> the whole vector
v(1:3) -> element 1 to 3 -> 1,2,3


## Addition and Subtraction of Vectors

Both the vectors must be of the same type and have the same number of elements.

```matlab
A = [7, 11, 15, 23, 9];
B = [2, 5, 13, 16, 20];
C = A + B;
D = A - B;
disp(C);
disp(D);
```


## Scalar Multiplication of Vectors

Multiplying a vector by a number.

```matlab
v = [ 12 34 10 8];
m = 5 * v
```

## Transpose of a Vector

Changes a column vector into row vector and vice-versa.

```matlab
r = [ 1 2 3 4 ];
tr = r';
v = [1;2;3;4];
tv = v';
disp(tr); disp(tv);
```

## Appending Vectors

The same constraints and properties apply to this as when crating vectors.

```matlab
r1 = [ 1 2 3 4 ];
r2 = [5 6 7 8 ];
r = [r1,r2]
rMat = [r1;r2]
 
c1 = [ 1; 2; 3; 4 ];
c2 = [5; 6; 7; 8 ];
c = [c1; c2]
cMat = [c1,c2]
```


## Magnitude of Vector

- Take the product of the vector with itself, using **array multiplication** (.*). This produces a vector sv, whose elements are squares of the elements of vector v.
    
    sv = v.*v;
    
- Use the sum function to get the **sum** of squares of elements of vector v. This is also called the dot product of vector v.
    
    dp= sum(sv);
    
- Use the **sqrt** function to get the square root of the sum which is also the magnitude of the vector v.
    
    mag = sqrt(s);

```matlab
v = [1: 2: 20];
sv = v.* v;

dp = sum(sv);
mag = sqrt(dp);
disp('Magnitude:'); 
disp(mag);
```


## Dot Product

Dot product of two vectors a and b is calculated using the **dot** function.

```matlab
v1 = [2 3 4];
v2 = [1 2 3];
dp = dot(v1, v2);
disp('Dot Product:'); 
disp(dp);
```


## Referencing Elements of a Matrix

```matlab
a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8];
a(2,5)
```

Reference all the elements in the mth column we type A(:,m).

```matlab
a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8];
v = a(:,4)
```

Select the elements in the mth through nth columns

```matlab
a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8];
a(:, 2:3)
```
