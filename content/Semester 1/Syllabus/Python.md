Hereâ€™s a **checklist** for the whole syllabus :

---

### **UNIT 1: Introduction to Python and Program Flow Control**

#### **Python Basics**

- [ ]  Understand Python variables and their declaration.
- [ ]  Work with basic operators (+, -, *, /, %, etc.).
- [ ]  Learn Python blocks and indentation rules.

#### **Data Types**

- [ ]  Identify basic Python data types (int, float, str, etc.).
- [ ]  Perform operations with numeric data types.

#### **Conditional Blocks**

- [ ]  Implement **if**, **else**, and **elif** conditional statements.
- [ ]  Write programs with nested conditional blocks.

#### **Loops**

- [ ]  Use **for** loops with ranges, strings, lists, and dictionaries.
- [ ]  Understand and apply **while** loops.
- [ ]  Utilize loop manipulation keywords:
    - [ ]  **pass**
    - [ ]  **continue**
    - [ ]  **break**
    - [ ]  **else** in loops.

#### **Programming Practice**

- [ ]  Solve problems combining conditionals and loop blocks.

### **UNIT 2: Python Data Structures**

#### **Strings**

- [ ]  Perform basic string operations (concatenation, slicing, repetition).
- [ ]  Apply string methods (`len()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, `find()`, etc.).

#### **Lists**

- [ ]  Create and manipulate lists.
- [ ]  Use list slicing for accessing subsets.
- [ ]  Apply common list methods (`append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, etc.).

#### **Tuples**

- [ ]  Create and work with tuples.
- [ ]  Understand when to use tuples over lists.

#### **Dictionaries**

- [ ]  Create and manipulate dictionaries.
- [ ]  Use dictionary methods (`keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `get()`, etc.).

#### **Functions**

- [ ]  Define and call functions.
- [ ]  Pass arguments and return values from functions.
- [ ]  Organize code using functions effectively.

### **UNIT 3: File Operations and Regular Expressions**

#### **File Operations**

- [ ]  Open and close files in Python.
- [ ]  Read files using:
    - [ ]  `read()`
    - [ ]  `readline()`
    - [ ]  `readlines()`
- [ ]  Write data to files using:
    - [ ]  `write()`
    - [ ]  `writelines()`.
- [ ]  Use `seek()` to manipulate file pointers.

#### **Regular Expressions**

- [ ]  Understand the basics of regular expressions.
- [ ]  Use Python's `re` module for:
    - [ ]  Pattern matching.
    - [ ]  Text processing with functions like `search()`, `match()`, and `findall()`.

### **UNIT 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Python**

#### **Introduction to OOP**

- [ ]  Understand the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

#### **Classes and Objects**

- [ ]  Define classes and create objects.
- [ ]  Access class attributes and methods using objects.

#### **Encapsulation**

- [ ]  Differentiate between public and private attributes.
- [ ]  Implement getter and setter methods.

#### **Inheritance**

- [ ]  Understand single and multiple inheritance.
- [ ]  Override methods in derived classes.

#### **Polymorphism**

- [ ]  Implement method overloading in Python.
- [ ]  Understand and apply method overriding.

#### **Constructors and Destructors**

- [ ]  Use the `__init__()` method to initialize class objects.
- [ ]  Understand the purpose of the `__del__()` method.

#### **Special Methods**

- [ ]  Implement `__str__()` and `__repr__()` methods for string representations.
- [ ]  Use operator overloading with special methods (`__add__`, `__sub__`, etc.).

#### **Practical Applications**

- [ ]  Work through case studies and examples to apply OOP concepts in real-world scenarios.
