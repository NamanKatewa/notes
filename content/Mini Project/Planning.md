|**Pathfinding in a Living Ecosystem**|Moderate|Minimal data: Requires map/grid data with obstacles and entities (e.g., predators, prey, water sources).|Medium: Great for education or gaming purposes but less directly applicable to real-world problems.|Moderate to High: Watching dynamic interactions and seeing creatures adapt to the environment is engaging.|- Creating engaging and realistic interactions. - Handling dynamic environments (e.g., fire spreading). - Ensuring performance with many agents.|
|**Pathfinding for Evacuation Planning**|High|Map/layout data of buildings or arenas, and dynamic hazard data (fire, obstacles).|High: Practical for emergency planning, safety analysis, and evacuation drills.|Moderate: Users design layouts, simulate scenarios, and test evacuation algorithms, which is interesting but niche.|- Generating dynamic hazards and recalculating paths efficiently. - Designing intuitive user interactions for layout creation. - Simulating realistic human evacuation behaviors.|
|**Smart Parking System**|Low to Moderate|Parking lot layouts, occupancy data (synthetic or real).|Medium: Useful in parking management, especially in urban areas.|Moderate: Users search for parking spots, input constraints, and interact with a simple simulation.|- Modeling parking spaces and rules. - Recalibrating paths based on dynamic occupancy. - Ensuring smooth integration of constraints like vehicle size and preferred spots.|
|**Public Transport Optimization**|High|Public transportation schedules, routes, and map data.|High: Valuable for navigating public transit systems efficiently.|Moderate: Users find optimized routes across multiple modes of transportation, but interaction is somewhat limited.|- Combining walking, public transport, and schedules into a single algorithm. - Handling real-time delays or route closures. - Accessing and integrating public transport datasets.|

### **Key Insights**

1. **Dynamic Traffic Simulation**:
    
    - Great choice if you want a **highly interactive and visually appealing project**.
    - Requires significant effort in generating synthetic traffic patterns and managing real-time recalculations, but it has high real-world value and user engagement.
2. **Pathfinding in a Living Ecosystem**:
    
    - Easier to implement since it doesn’t require external data but relies on algorithms and simulations.
    - Best suited for **educational or gaming contexts**. It is less practical for real-world applications but visually engaging.
3. **Pathfinding for Evacuation Planning**:
    
    - Has strong **practical relevance** in safety and urban planning but is technically challenging.
    - Requires building tools for users to design layouts and simulate complex scenarios dynamically.
4. **Smart Parking System**:
    
    - Easier and smaller in scope compared to others. Ideal if you want to **focus on core pathfinding algorithms with simple constraints**.
    - Less visually engaging but practical and straightforward.
5. **Public Transport Optimization**:
    
    - Highly valuable for real-world applications but **data-heavy** and technically challenging, especially if you include real-time updates.
    - Less visually dynamic since much of the value lies in optimizing schedules and travel paths.
