### **Key Insights**

**Pathfinding for Evacuation Planning**:
    
    - Has strong **practical relevance** in safety and urban planning but is technically challenging.
    - Requires building tools for users to design layouts and simulate complex scenarios dynamically.
---

### **Recommendation Based on Priorities**

- **Highly impactful but challenging project**: Choose **Pathfinding for Evacuation Planning**. Itâ€™s demanding but has real-world value.

### **Pathfinding for Evacuation Planning**

#### **Steps to Implement**:

1. **Create Map Layouts**:
    
    - Allow users to draw or load building layouts.
    - Mark key points: entrances, exits, rooms, and obstacles.
2. **Model the Graph**:
    
    - Represent the layout as a graph (nodes = rooms/hallways, edges = paths with weights based on distance).
    - Include dynamic weights for hazards (e.g., fire spreading increases edge weights).
3. **Simulate Evacuation**:
    
    - Use pathfinding algorithms to simulate evacuation routes for agents (people).
    - Introduce dynamic hazard events like blocked exits or spreading fires.
4. **Visualize Evacuation**:
    
    - Use **Pygame** to display the building layout and simulate people moving along evacuation routes.
    - Highlight bottlenecks and hazards in real-time.
5. **User Interactions**:
    
    - Allow users to place hazards or block exits dynamically.
    - Provide analysis of evacuation efficiency (e.g., time taken, number of people evacuated).
6. **Dynamic Path Recalculation**:
    
    - Recalculate paths in real-time when hazards are introduced.

### **Pathfinding for Evacuation Planning**

**Problem Statement**: In emergencies like fires, earthquakes, or other disasters, evacuation plans often fail due to bottlenecks, poor route design, or unaccounted hazards. A tool that simulates evacuation scenarios, dynamically recalculates routes, and visualizes evacuation efficiency can improve safety and save lives in real-world emergencies.

**Key Problems Solved**:

- Testing and optimizing evacuation plans for buildings, arenas, or cities.
- Simulating bottlenecks and dynamic hazards like blocked exits or fires.
- Improving evacuation safety and response planning.
