## Functionality

- Degree of performance
- Set of features and capability
- Determines the usefulness

EXAMPLES -- 
- Data Storage & Retrieval
- Data Processing & Manipulation
- User Interface & Navigation
- Communication & Networking
- Security & Access Control
- Reporting & Visualization
- Automation & Scripting

## Reliability

- Capability of software to maintain a level of performance over a period of time.
- Perform intended functions correctly and consistently over time.
- Considered reliable when probability of it failing is low, and is able to recover from failure.

EXAMPLES -- 
- Bugs & Errors
- Lack of testing & Validation
- Poorly designed DSA
- Poor error handling & recovery
- Incompatibilities
