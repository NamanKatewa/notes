**Software Engineering** is the process of ==Designing== ==Developing== ==Testing== ==Maintaining== Software.

Systematic and Disciplined Approach.

Goals - 
- High-Quality
- Reliable
- Maintainable

1. Includes a variety of **techniques**, **tools**, **methodologies** like **requirement analysis**, **design testing**, **maintenance**
2. Rapidly Evolving Field. Constantly new tools are being developed.
3. By following these principles, developers can fulfill the demands of their users efficiently.
4. Mainly used for large projects based on software systems
5. Gives a framework to follow, which helps improve quality, budget and time efficiency of software
6. Ensures that the project is consistent

![[SE Phases.png]]

**Phase 1: Planning**
- Initial phase
- Scope is defined
- Goals, Objectives, Constraints determined
- Project plan is created
- Detailing the tasks, Timelines, and resources

**Phase 2: Requirement Engineering** 
- System requirements gathered and analyzed
- Align with the stakeholders, understanding their needs
- Documenting the requirements for further use.

**Phase 3: Design**
- Blueprint for system is created
- Architecture, Components, Interfaces, Data are designed

**Phase 4: System Development**
- Actual development of the software
- Built on top of the requirements and the design specifications

**Phase 5: Testing**
- Validating to ensure it meets the standard and is as expected.
- Unit , Integration, System, User Acceptance Testing

**Phase 6: Deployment**
- Deployed to production
- Installation, Configuration

**Phase 7: Training**
- Provided to end-users to help them understand and use the software.
- Ensures user comfortability

**Phase 8: Maintenance**
- Constant support, Fixing Bugs, Making Updates, Feature Changes.
