A tool that tracks changes in files ( by extension code )
Helps collaborate with others without messing things up.

**Version Control**
"Save Game" for your projects.
Saves the current state of the project.
Can visit or revert back to any "version"

**Installing Git**

**Git Repository ( Repo for short )**
"Storage Space" per se.
Tracks all the **files, changes and history**

**An Analogy**

Project Folder - Repo 
Git - Security camera that records every change you make to the house (adding furniture, painting walls)
Version Control - Recordings that we can see, review or delete or revert back to.
