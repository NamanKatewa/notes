# What is?

- In charge of making sure the system operates correctly and efficiently in as easy-to-use manner.

- The primary way it does this is through [[Virtualization]].

- In order to allow users to tell the OS what to do, OS provides some interfaces (ways) (APIs) that you can call.

- A typical OS exports **System Calls**, which are available to the applications. (Could be also said said as OS provides a standard library to applications).

- Virtualization allows many programs to run (sharing CPU), to concurrently access instructions and data (sharing memory), access devices (sharing disks), OS could also be called a **Resource Manager**.
