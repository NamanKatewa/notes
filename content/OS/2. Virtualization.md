## Definition - **Running Program**

Program - Instructions

**Time Sharing** of the CPU. Cost is **Performance**.

OS needs low-level machinery (**mechanisms**), high level intelligence (**policies**).

## Mechanisms - Protocols for functionality.

### Time sharing
Basic technique used by an OS to share a resource. By allowing the resource to be used for a little while by one entity, and then a little while by another, and so forth, the resource in question (e.g., the CPU, or a network link) can be shared by many.

### Space sharing
A resource is divided (in space) among those who wish to use it. For example, disk space is naturally a space shared resource

## Policies - Algorithms for making some kind of decision (Conditional).

**Scheduling Policy** - Given a number of programs to run, deciding which to actually run

## Process

The abstraction provided by the OS of a running program is something we will call a process.

**Machine State** - what a program can read or update when it is running. At any given time, what parts of the machine are important to the execution of this program.

The assigned memory of a process is called its **address space**.

**Mechanism** - Providing answers to how. E.g. - How does an operating system perform context switching

**Policy** - Provides answer too a which question. E.g. - Which process should the operating system run?
