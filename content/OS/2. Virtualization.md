# Process

## Definition - **Running Program**

Program - Instructions

**Time Sharing** of the CPU. Cost is **Performance**.

OS needs low-level machinery (**mechanisms**), high level intelligence (**policies**).

## Mechanisms - Protocols for functionality.

### Time sharing
Basic technique used by an OS to share a resource. By allowing the resource to be used for a little while by one entity, and then a little while by another, and so forth, the resource in question (e.g., the CPU, or a network link) can be shared by many.

### Space sharing
A resource is divided (in space) among those who wish to use it. For example, disk space is naturally a space shared resource

## Policies - Algorithms for making some kind of decision (Conditional).

**Scheduling Policy** - Given a number of programs to run, deciding which to actually run

## Process

The abstraction provided by the OS of a running program is something we will call a process.

**Machine State** - what a program can read or update when it is running. At any given time, what parts of the machine are important to the execution of this program.

The assigned memory of a process is called its **address space**.

**Mechanism** - Providing answers to how. E.g. - How does an operating system perform context switching

**Policy** - Provides answer to a which question. E.g. - Which process should the operating system run?

# Process API 

Basic Requirements for a process API

## Create

Method to Create new processes.

Typing a command into the shell, or opening an application invokes the OS to create a new process

## Destroy

Interface to destroy processes forcefully.

Many processes will run and just exit by themselves. But still OS need to provide a method to kill processes manually by the user.

## Wait

Interface to wait for a process to stop running.

## Miscellaneous Control

Suspend( stop it from running a while )

Resume( Continue running )

## Status

Get status info.

# Creating a Process

1 - Load code and static data into memory ( address space of the process )

Types of loading process - **Eagerly** & **Lazily**

2 - Initializing the heap and stack.

3 - Some more initializations - File Descriptors ( input / output / error)

4 - Provide an entry point ( OS gives control of the CPU to the process )

# Process States

## Running (Single Process)

Currently running, executing instructions

## Ready

Ready to run

## Blocked

Not ready to run until some other event takes place. (E.g. waiting for user input)

Process -> How are we changing the states? - Mechanism
			Which state to change in? - Policy

**Process List** - List of Processes

![[Pasted image 20250226210206.png]]

**PCB** - a structure that contains information about a specific process.



## fork()

- To create a new process
- An exact copy of the process is created.
- The newly-created process(child) doesn't start running at main(), instead it runs the code you specify.

## wait()
- waits for the child process to complete executing

## exec()
- Run a program that is different from the calling program.

## kill()
- To send signals to a process, (pause, die)

## signal()
- To receive signals.
