Yes, learning programming basics before diving into a specific language is an excellent idea. This approach helps you understand the core concepts that are applicable across most programming languages, making it easier to pick up a language later. Here’s a detailed plan for you:

---

### **Step 1: Understand What Programming Is**

- **Goal:** Learn what programming is and why it’s important.
- **Topics to Cover:**
    - What is programming? (Instructions for a computer to solve problems)
    - Applications of programming (web development, game development, data analysis, etc.)
    - Overview of programming languages (Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.)
- **Resources:**
    - Videos: "What is Programming?" by FreeCodeCamp or similar.
    - Articles: "Beginner's Guide to Programming" (from online blogs).

---

### **Step 2: Learn Computational Thinking**

- **Goal:** Develop problem-solving skills and understand how to break tasks into steps.
- **Topics to Cover:**
    - **Decomposition:** Breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts.
    - **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying similarities or trends in problems.
    - **Abstraction:** Focusing on the important details while ignoring unnecessary ones.
    - **Algorithms:** A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
- **Exercises:**
    - Write instructions for everyday tasks (e.g., making a sandwich).
    - Solve basic logic puzzles and riddles.

### **Step 3: Dive Into Key Programming Concepts**

- **Goal:** Understand foundational programming concepts without focusing on a specific syntax.
- **Topics to Cover:**
    1. **Variables and Data Types:**
        - Storing and manipulating data.
        - Common data types (numbers, text, booleans).
    2. **Operators:**
        - Arithmetic (+, -, *, /).
        - Comparison (>, <, ==).
    3. **Control Structures:**
        - **Conditionals:** If-else logic to make decisions.
        - **Loops:** Repeating tasks using `for` and `while`.
    4. **Functions:**
        - Writing reusable blocks of code.
        - Input, output, and return values.
    5. **Data Structures:**
        - Lists, arrays, dictionaries, and how they are used.
    6. **Debugging:**
        - Identifying and fixing errors in logic.

---

### **Step 4: Learn Pseudocode and Flowcharts**

- **Goal:** Develop a way to plan your programs visually or in plain language.
- **Topics to Cover:**
    - Writing pseudocode: Describe program logic in simple English.
    - Drawing flowcharts: Use diagrams to represent the flow of a program.
- **Exercises:**
    - Write pseudocode for everyday problems (e.g., calculating the total price of items).
    - Draw flowcharts for simple tasks (e.g., deciding what to eat for breakfast).

---

### **Step 5: Get Familiar with the Basics of Computers**

- **Goal:** Understand how computers work and how programming interacts with hardware.
- **Topics to Cover:**
    - What is hardware and software?
    - How does a computer process instructions?
    - What is memory (RAM vs. storage)?
    - Overview of operating systems.

---

### **Step 6: Introduction to Problem-Solving with Algorithms**

- **Goal:** Learn to create efficient solutions to problems.
- **Topics to Cover:**
    - Basic algorithms (sorting, searching).
    - Concepts of efficiency (time complexity, space complexity – start with an overview).
    - Writing step-by-step solutions.
- **Exercises:**
    - Solve basic algorithm challenges on beginner-friendly platforms like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) or [Edabit](https://edabit.com/).

---

### **Step 7: Start Exploring a Language**

- After completing these steps, you'll have a solid foundation to choose a beginner-friendly programming language like **Python** or **JavaScript**. These languages are great because they have a simple syntax and are widely used.
