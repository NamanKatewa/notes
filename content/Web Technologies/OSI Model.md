**Open System Interconnection**

- Reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.
- Seven Layers. Each layer performs a particular network function.
- Each layer is self contained. The task assigned can be performed independently.

- Two layers - upper & lower
- **Upper Layer** - deals with application related issues.
- Implemented only in the software.
- **Lower Layer** - deals with data transport issues.
- Implemented in hardware & software.

# Physical Layer

- Transmit individual bits from one node to another node
- Lowest layer
- Establishes, maintains and deactivates the physical connection
- Specifies mechanical, electrical & procedural network interface specifications

## Line Configuration

- Defines the way how two or more devices can be connected physically.

## Data Transmission

- Defines the transmission mode whether it is simplex, half-duplex or full-duplex

## Topology

- Defines the way how network devices are arranged

## Signals

- Determines the type of signal used for transmitting the info

# Data Link Layer

- Responsible for
