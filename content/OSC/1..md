### What an Operating System Does

The OS handles:

- **Loading** programs (process creation)
- **Scheduling** processes/threads
- **Memory management**
- **I/O** abstraction and control
- **Security** and **access control**
- **System control** and **debugging tools**

### Evaluation Criteria for a ‚ÄúGood‚Äù OS

- **Efficiency**: Maximizes hardware usage
- **Fairness**: Distributes resources properly
- **Reliability**: Keeps working under faults
- **Security**: Defends against misuse
- **Usability**: Helps users be productive
- **Abstraction**: Provides high-level interfaces
- **Simplicity**: Maintainable, secure design

### Core Concepts (5 Key Topics)

1. **Address Space**
    
    - Memory is numbered; each process has its own address space.
        
    - Enables isolation and portability.
        
2. **Loading a Program**
    
    - Turns a static binary into a running process.
        
    - Involves copying code/data to memory, setting up stack/heap.
        
3. **User vs System (Kernel) Mode**
    
    - User mode restricts access to sensitive hardware.
        
    - Kernel mode allows full control.
        
    - Switching modes happens via **system calls** or **interrupts**.
        
4. **Limited Direct Execution**
    
    - Programs run on real hardware, not virtual machines.
        
    - OS maintains control via **interrupts** and **preemptive scheduling**.
        
5. **System Calls**
    
    - Special interface to invoke OS functions.
        
    - Require mode switch and specific CPU instructions.

### üåÄ Concurrency & Parallelism

- **Concurrency**: Multiple tasks that appear to run at the same time.
    
- **Parallelism**: Truly simultaneous execution on different hardware units.
    
- **OS provides** concurrent abstractions (e.g. processes, threads).
    
- OS **internally concurrent** because hardware is parallel (e.g. I/O and CPU at once).

### üß∞ Bonus: Stack Fundamentals (Theoretical)

- Stack = LIFO data structure
    
- Used for **procedure calls**, **interrupt handling**
    
- Managed with a **stack pointer**
    
- Essential for maintaining **execution context**
