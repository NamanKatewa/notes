# Components of a Computer System

## Disks

- Storage devices that store data permanently
- Modern computers use **SSD** (Solid State Drives) or **HDD** (Hard Drives) for long-term storage
- They store files, applications, and the operating system

## Memory / RAM (Random Access Memory)

- Volatile memory used to store data temporarily while programs are running
- Allows quick access for active purposes, which makes the system faster

## Processor / CPU (Central Processing Unit)

- Brain of the computer (IK ðŸ˜‚).
- Performs the computations & executes instructions from programs
- **Speed** & **Performance** of a CPU is critical for the speed of the computer

## OS (Operating System)

- Software that manages hardware resources & provides an interface for users to interact.
- Handles **Process Management**, **Memory Management**, **File System Operations**.
- Eg - Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS

## Compilers

- Program that translates source code written in a programming language into machine code (i.e. Binary) that the computer can understand & execute


# Computation & Its Principles

- **Computation refers to the process of performing calculations or processing data by a computer**

## Data Representation

- Data is represented in Binary format.
- Number, Text, Image, Audio, Videos are all stored & processed as binary data

## Algorithms

- Step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a task.
- Foundation of programming

## Efficiency

- Efficient computation ensures that tasks are completed quickly & with least amount of resources (time & memory)

# The Idea of Algorithms

**An algorithm is a structured set of instructions used to solve a problem**

- **Understand the problem :** Clearly define the Inputs & Outputs
- **Devise a plan :** Break the problem into smaller steps, each performing a specific task
- **Implement the solution :** Write the steps in a programming language as a program
- **Test the solution :** Verify the algorithm produces the correct result

# Algorithm Representations

## Flowcharts

- Graphical representation of algorithms

## Pseudo Code

- Informal way yo write algorithms using plain english
- Not actual code but provides a clear idea of how the program should function

```mathematica

%% Example of Pseudo Code fro adding two numbers %%

Start
	Read num1
	Read num2
	sum = num1 + num2
	Print sum
End
```
