- Requirements are divided into multiple standalone modules.
- Each module goes through design, implementation & testing phase.
- Every subsequent release of the module adds functionality to the previous release.

## Requirement Analysis

- Identification of the requirements.
## Design & Development

- Designed & Development is finished

## Testing

- Checks the performance of existing functions & additional.

## Implementation

- Integrated with the rest of the system, made available to the public for testing.
