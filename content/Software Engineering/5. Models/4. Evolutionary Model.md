![[Evolutionary Model.png]]
- Divides the development cycle into smaller [[3. Incremental Waterfall Model]] in which users can get access to the product at the end of each cycle
- Feedback is provided by users on the product for planning stage of next cycle.
- Software evolves with time

# Application

- Used in large projects
- When the customer wants to start using the core features instead of waiting for the full software
- Used in Object Oriented, easily portioned into units in terms of objects.

# Necessary Conditions

- Customer needs are clear
- Might be small changes required in separate parts
- Risk is high
- Used when working with new technologies to give developers time to adjust

# Advantages

## Adaptability

- Work effectively in projects when requirements are ambiguous (change often)
- Support adjustments & flexibility along the course of development

## Early & Gradual Distribution

- Functional components or prototypes can be delivered early
- Faster user satisfaction

## User Commentary & Involvement

- Strong emphasis on ongoing user input & participation
- Software closely matches the needs & expectations of the user
## Improved Handling of Difficult Projects

- Big & complex tasks can be effectively managed
- Development process is made simpler by segmenting the project into smaller & easier to manage portions

# Disadvantages

## Communication Difficulties

- Require constant cooperation & communication.
- If gaps in communication, it might be less effective
- Less effective if team members are spread out geographically

## Dependence on Expert Group

- An experienced group that can quickly make the changes is needed
- Teams lacking experience may find it difficult to handle

## Management Complexity

- Complexity increased by organizing & managing several increments or iterations
- Good project management is needed

## Greater Initial Expenditure

- Greater starting cost
- Problem for projects with limited funding
